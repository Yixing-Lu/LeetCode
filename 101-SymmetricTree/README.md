Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` is symmetric:

â€‹    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3

**Approach 1 Recursive**

A tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.

Two trees are a mirror reflection of each other if:

1. Their two roots have the same value.
2. The right subtree of each tree is a mirror reflection of the left subtree of the other tree.

```java
public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
    return isMirror(root, root);
}

public boolean isMirror(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
    if (t1 == null && t2 == null) return true;
    if (t1 == null || t2 == null) return false;
    return (t1.val == t2.val)
        && isMirror(t1.right, t2.left)
        && isMirror(t1.left, t2.right);
}
```

Time complexity : O(n) Because we traverse the entire input tree once,

Space complexity : The number of recursive calls is bound by the height of the tree. In the worst case, the tree is linear and the height is in O(n). Therefore, space complexity due to recursive calls on the stack is O(n) in the worst case.

**Approach 2 Iterative**

 Each two consecutive nodes in the queue should be equal, and their subtrees a mirror of each other. Initially, the queue contains `root` and `root`. Then the algorithm works similarly to BFS, with some key differences. Each time, two nodes are extracted and their values compared. Then, the right and left children of the two nodes are inserted in the queue in opposite order. The algorithm is done when either the queue is empty, or we detect that the tree is not symmetric

```java
public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
    Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
    q.add(root);
    q.add(root);
    while (!q.isEmpty()) {
        TreeNode t1 = q.poll();
        TreeNode t2 = q.poll();
        if (t1 == null && t2 == null) continue;
        if (t1 == null || t2 == null) return false;
        if (t1.val != t2.val) return false;
        q.add(t1.left);
        q.add(t2.right);
        q.add(t1.right);
        q.add(t2.left);
    }
    return true;
}
```

Time complexity : O(n). Because we traverse the entire input tree once, the total run time is O(n)

Space complexity : There is additional space required for the search queue. In the worst case, we have to insert O(n) nodes in the queue. Therefore, space complexity is O(n)
