Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number `N` on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a *move* consisting of:

- Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < N` and `N % x == 0`.
- Replacing the number `N` on the chalkboard with `N - x`.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return `True` if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

Conclusion
If N is even, can win.
If N is odd, will lose.

Recursive Prove ï¼ˆTop-down)
If N is even.
We can choose x = 1.
The opponent will get N - 1, which is a odd.
Reduce to the case odd and he will lose.

If N is odd,
2.1 If N = 1, lose directly.
2.2 We have to choose an odd x.
The opponent will get N - x, which is a even.
Reduce to the case even and he will win.

So the N will change odd and even alternatively until N = 1.

```java
return N % 2 == 0;
```
