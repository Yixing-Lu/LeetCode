Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number **n**, return if **n** new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

---

> Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
> Output: True

> Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
> Output: False

---

We can find out the extra maximum number of flowers, count, that can be planted for the given flowerbed arrangement. To do so, we can traverse over all the elements of the flowerbed and find out those elements which are 0(implying an empty position). For every such element, we check if its both adjacent positions are also empty. If so, we can plant a flower at the current position without violating the no-adjacent-flowers-rule. For the first and last elements, we need not check the previous and the next adjacent positions respectively.

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        int i = 0, count = 0;
        while (i < flowerbed.length) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && (i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) && 
                (i == flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                count++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return count >= n;
    }
}

```
