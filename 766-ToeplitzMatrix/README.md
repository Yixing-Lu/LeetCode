A matrix is *Toeplitz* if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same element.

Now given an `M x N` matrix, return `True` if and only if the matrix is *Toeplitz*.

>Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,1,2,3],
  [9,5,1,2]
]
Output: True

**Approach 1 Compare Top-Left neighbor**

The matrix is *Toeplitz* if and only if all of these conditions are true for all (top-left to bottom-right) diagonals.

Every element belongs to some diagonal, and it's previous element (if it exists) is it's top-left neighbor. Thus, for the square `(r, c)`, we only need to check `r == 0 OR c == 0 OR matrix[r-1][c-1] == matrix[r][c]`.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isToeplitzMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        for (int r = 0; r < matrix.length; ++r)
            for (int c = 0; c < matrix[0].length; ++c)
                if (r > 0 && c > 0 && matrix[r-1][c-1] != matrix[r][c])
                    return false;
        return true;
    }
}
```

- Time Complexity: O(MN), as defined in the problem statement.
- Space Complexity: O(1).

**Approach 2 Group by Category**

It turns out two coordinates are on the same diagonal if and only if `r1 - c1 == r2 - c2`.

This leads to the following idea: remember the value of that diagonal as `groups[r-c]`. If we see a mismatch, the matrix is not Toeplitz; otherwise it is.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isToeplitzMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> groups = new HashMap();
        for (int r = 0; r < matrix.length; ++r) {
            for (int c = 0; c < matrix[0].length; ++c) {
                if (!groups.containsKey(r-c))
                    groups.put(r-c, matrix[r][c]);
                else if (groups.get(r-c) != matrix[r][c])
                    return False;
            }
        }
        return True;
    }
}
```

- Time Complexity: *O*(*M*âˆ—*N*). (Recall in the problem statement that M, N are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`.)
- Space Complexity: O*(*M*+*N).
