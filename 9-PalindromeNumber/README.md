Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

> Input: 121
> Output: true

First of all we should take care of some edge cases. All negative numbers are not palindrome, for example: -123 is not a palindrome since the '-' does not equal to '3'. So we can return false for all negative numbers.

Now let's think about how to revert the last half of the number. For number `1221`, if we do `1221 % 10`, we get the last digit `1`, to get the second to the last digit, we need to remove the last digit from `1221`, we could do so by dividing it by 10, `1221 / 10 = 122`. Then we can get the last digit again by doing a modulus by 10, `122 % 10 = 2`, and if we multiply the last digit by 10 and add the second last digit, `1 * 10 + 2 = 12`, it gives us the reverted number we want. Continuing this process would give us the reverted number with more digits.

Now the question is, how do we know that we've reached the half of the number?

Since we divided the number by 10, and multiplied the reversed number by 10, when the original number is less than the reversed number, it means we've processed half of the number digits.

```java
public class Solution {
    public bool IsPalindrome(int x) {
        // Special cases:
        // As discussed above, when x < 0, x is not a palindrome.
        // Also if the last digit of the number is 0, in order to be a palindrome,
        // the first digit of the number also needs to be 0.
        // Only 0 satisfy this property.
        if(x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) {
            return false;
        }

        int revertedNumber = 0;
        while(x > revertedNumber) {
            revertedNumber = revertedNumber * 10 + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }

        // When the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by revertedNumber/10
        // For example when the input is 12321, at the end of the while loop we get x = 12, revertedNumber = 123,
        // since the middle digit doesn't matter in palidrome(it will always equal to itself), we can simply get rid of it.
        return x == revertedNumber || x == revertedNumber/10;
    }
}
```

- Time complexity : $O(\log_{10}(n))$. We divided the input by 10 for every iteration, so the time complexity is $O(\log_{10}(n))$
- Space complexity : O(1)
