In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.

Return `true` if and only if you can choose `X >= 2` such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

- Each group has exactly `X` cards.
- All the cards in each group have the same integer.

**Approach 1 Brute Force**Since we divide the deck of `N` cards into say, `K` piles of `X` cards each, we must have `N % X == 0`.

Then, say the deck has `C_i` copies of cards with number `i`. Each group with number `i` has `X` copies, so we must have `C_i % X == 0`. These are necessary and sufficient conditions.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasGroupsSizeX(int[] deck) {
        int N = deck.length;
        int[] count = new int[10000];
        for (int c: deck)
            count[c]++;

        List<Integer> values = new ArrayList();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i)
            if (count[i] > 0)
                values.add(count[i]);

        search: for (int X = 2; X <= N; ++X)
            if (N % X == 0) {
                for (int v: values)
                    if (v % X != 0)
                        continue search;
                return true;
            }

        return false;
    }
}
```
